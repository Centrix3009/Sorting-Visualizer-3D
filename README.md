# A Sorting Visualizer 3D Modal

## Interactive Bar Component with Bubble Sort Visualization
This project features an interactive bar component where users can easily adjust the height of each bar and visualize the sorting process in real time. What sets this project apart is the ability to instantly update the bar heights and see how those changes affect the sorting algorithm. The bubble sort algorithm is visualized with smooth color transitions, helping users clearly understand the sorting steps. The interface is user-friendly and provides a more engaging way to explore how sorting algorithms work.
